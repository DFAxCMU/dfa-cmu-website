She has never lived directly on the streets, but has moved around from house to house. Because of this, she has never attended the same school. She eventually ran away and stopped attending school, making it almost impossible for Allegheny county to keep track of her and she never graduated with a high school degree.\bDaniel is an 18 year old whose parents died when he was very young. He never had formal guidance and attended several schools for homeless youth. His being there allowed Allegheny county to keep track of him and they were therefore able to keep him in the same school for all four years of high school. However, all his records are not managed well, thus his admission is not reflected in some files, making it hard for Allegheny county to keep track of the total number of students.","Slap Stats:\b22,765 homeless children in Pittsburgh 2013-2014\b1 out of every 30 children experienced homelessness in 2013\b87% of homeless youth enrolled in school vs. 77% regularly attend\nStakeholders:\bNicole Anderson\bHomeless Children\bFamilies of Homeless Children\bSchool Counties",,,"Looking at past projects, we targeted ""How Can We?"" questions and qualifications that we want our solution to have in order to come up with our own new prototype.

Sustain CMU,Spring 2021-Present,Sustainability,"Sustain CMU is a project addressing waste management issues on CMU's campus. Carnegie Mellon has given their on-campus dining options 100% compostable packaging and intends to start offering compost bins in on-campus housing, but thus far their efforts to encourage correct waste disposal among the students seem to be ineffective. We are trying to come up with a solution that will close the knowledge gap and/or incentivize students to dispose of their waste correctly.","Team Lead: Kelly Wang\nOther Members: Sarah Xi, Michelle Zhang, Shannon Lin, Eric Zhao",None,"We have a small team already and are planning to build and test prototypes in the fall. Thus, new members would only get to experience the second half of the design process.\nThat said, if you're excited about the topic, we would still love to have you! Our solutions clustered around signage or other visual assets, so the work might involve graphic design (though graphic design skills are not required); we will also definitely need to work with stakeholders, which in this case are your fellow students.",Kelly's Email,kkwang@andrew.cmu.edu,,"The project originally focused on reducing plastic waste, especially in the face of the pandemic.\bHow can we promote the use of reusable PPE on campus during the pandemic, as opposed to single-use?\bHow can we encourage more efficient plastic packaging in CMU dining services?\bHow can we encourage more non-plastic packaging in CMU dining services during the pandemic?\bHow can we spread accurate information about reusable products to CMU students?\bHow can we inform students about proper disposal of PPE?","\bPeople/businesses would be open to switching to more sustainable options if they understood its value\bReducing and reusing are the most feasible and cost-efficient waste management actions, in comparison to recycling\bBusinesses and restaurants have a strong influence over single-use plastic usage in communities\bProper placement of sinks would improve convenience and likelihood of using reusable containers\bUnnecessary food packaging has potential for modification without intense drawbacks","\bAlex is an RA who wants to be a good person and take care of the kids on his floor, but he can't always answer his resident's questions about how to throw away specific items. He knows about the recycling bins in general and how to use them, but sometimes it's hard to tell whether a plastic is actually recyclable. He also wants to cook himself to be sustainable, but doesn't have time to cook, and when his mental health is suffering and things are crazy in his life sustainability is not a concern he can afford to care about. \bErica is a sophomore who wants to go along her life as usual, and prefers the convenience of single-use items. She feels guilty that it isn't sustainable, but she often feels apathetic about it because she believes her actions will have minimal effect compared to the actions of governments or large companies. She thinks single-use items aren't that much more convenient than reusable ones in general, but a campus setting is ""more public"" and she isn't comfortable reusing items that other people used (for hygiene reasons). She is also generally unaware of sustainability initiatives on campus, and finds it hard to compost normally because she lives off-campus.\bEllie is a freshman who is just getting used to college life, so sometimes she is too busy or lazy to make environmentally-friendly decisions, though she'll make them if there's signage or if there's outside motivation to avoid single-use items. When asked about recycling or compost on campus, she just knows that the school has bins to separate different kinds of trash, so she assumes CMU recycles and composts but she doesn't really know how to use them. She eats exclusively on-campus, because of the freshman meal plan.\bEric is a junior who is knowledgeable of sustainability topics and is intrinsically motivated to be sustainable. He says he doesn't optimize his life around being environmentally-friendly, but if there's a clear dichotomy he'll make the sustainable decision even if it's a bit inconvenient. If he has time to think ahead and prepare, he'll bring his own reusable bags or tupperware to shop/eat outside, but there are times when he doesn't think ahead or he's just too lazy. He also says it's hard to keep motivation up if it seems like others aren't taking sustainability seriously.","We did surveys and interviews with CMU students, and also did interviews with people who were knowledgeable about the topic: students in Sustainable Earth, CMU's environmental coordinator, CMU's chief risk officer, a researcher in CMU's Green Design Institute, a CMU professor who teaches Sustainable Materials, and a CMU professor who does transition design.\nOn the pandemic:\bNot much can be changed about safety precautions during the pandemic, as safety is the #1 priority\bMany plans were interrupted due to the pandemic, but dining will probably return to using compostables and housing will probably try to update their waste system to include compost bins\nOn the student body:\bThere is a lot of inconsistency in the student body in terms of how much they know how to recycle/compost\bThe biggest factors promoting sustainable decisions seem to be convenience, establishing habits, and learning sustainable practices from RAs\bStudents are generally unaware of campus sustainability initiatives\nOn changing behavior:\bSustainable Earth is currently working on an app to encourage sustainable behaviors by rewarding these actions\bBefore we can judge the tradeoffs people are willing to make, you have to first make sure everyone has the key pieces of information requires to make a decision\bIt's important to understand people are heterogenous and fall into different camps; some people aren't worth trying to persuade and some people don't need persuasion, so you care about targeting the people in the middle\bIf you tell people information they already know, it seems as if you don't care about them specifically\bFlyers would be most effective if they were seen at the point of making a decision","Based on the insights we got from the Immerse step, and because campus activity seemed like it would soon return to normal, we decided to focus instead on proper waste management on campus.\bHow can we spread accurate information on correct recycling/composting?\bHow can we persuade people on campus to make the effort to follow recycling/composting guidelines?\bHow can we make people pay close attention to these guidelines, regardless of prior interest in sustainability?\bHow can we communicate recycling/composting guidelines in a consistent way without significantly changing the existing infrastructure?",\bConvince students of the importance of knowing how to correctly sort waste\bHave students know how to correctly sort waste\bMake it more convenient to correctly sort waste,"We came up with a variety of possible design solutions and sorted them based on the amount of effort it would take (lower = less effort, higher = more effort) and whether it focused on increasing knowledge of the issue (to the left) or increasing convenience/motivation (to the right).
