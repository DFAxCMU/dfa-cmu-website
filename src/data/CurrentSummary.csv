Sustain CMU,Sustainability,"Kelly Wang, Sarah Xi, Michelle Zhang, Shannon Lin, Eric Zhao","Sustain CMU is a project addressing waste management issues on CMU's campus. Carnegie Mellon has given their on-campus dining options 100% compostable packaging and intends to start offering compost bins in on-campus housing, but thus far their efforts to encourage correct waste disposal among the students seem to be ineffective. We are trying to come up with a solution that will close the knowledge gap and/or incentivize students to dispose of their waste correctly.",sustain-cmu
